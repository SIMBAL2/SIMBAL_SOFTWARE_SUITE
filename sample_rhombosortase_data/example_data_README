Here is what is contained in the sample_rhombosortase_data directory
rhomb_config                    a sample TSB configuration file for collecting rhombosortase in the yes set, other rhomboid family proteins in the no set
rhombosortase_no.seqs           sample TSB output for the NO set, based on the rhomb_config
rhombosortase_no.clust.seqs     rhombosortase_no.seqs non-redundified at 80% using usearch
rhombosortase_yes.seqs           sample TSB output for the YES set, based on the rhomb_config
rhombosortase_yes.clust.seqs     rhombosortase_yes.seqs non-redundified at 80% using usearch
query_rhomb                     a sample query rhombosortase for use in SIMBAL (along with the two clust.seqs files)
rhombosortase_raw.txt           SIMBAL output from the previous data, ready for plotting in R
rhombosortase_rescored.txt      rhombosortase_raw.txt run through the plume interpreter at 93% heritability, ready for plotting in R



These are intended to serve simply as sample data and to allow testing of one piece of the software suite without requiring running
prior components. This data was created by running the software, with no additional modification, but should not be used for reference
purposes. TSB does require HMMs to be downloaded and present in the locations given in the configuration file - to test TSB using 
rhomb_config, either change the HMM paths in the config_file, or put the proper HMMs in that file location (changing paths is likely
easier)

For instructions on how to run the software refer to ../USAGE_INSTRUCTIONS   or check the individual programs for a description of the 
runtime flags.
